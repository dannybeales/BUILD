Load Build V2.
You will need to load the application in 1280 x 720 and then stretch the width accross all of your screen - We have a aspect ratio problem at the moment. 

Then your ready to go. 

to pass each level you will need your block/character to be touching the Gray area with the gravity at its original position.

What are your comments on the reversal of gravity: 

How does the Bouncing of the weight feel: Does is feel like a realistic bounce? etc

What are your thoughts on the Camera flip for the gravity change? 

Would you prefer all the blocks to move upwards towards the top, rather than the screen flip itself? 

Does the game feel competative agaisnt your opponent? 

Is the game easy to play? 

Do you feel 13 - 25 year olds is the best age catagory for the game?
